# serpinski_trianngle
MATLAB and Python demonstrations of the serpinski triangle. The serpinski triangle is automatically formed by the following 6 steps:
1. Take any three points in a plane to form a triangle
2. Randomly select any point inside the triangle and consider that your current position
3. Randomly select any of the three vertex points
4. Move half the distance from your current position (defined in step 2) to the selected vertex
5. Plot this halfway point
6. Repeat from step 3 until the serpinski triangle begins to show it's form
